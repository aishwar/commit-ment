I have wondered, how do people find time to work in open source projects? It feels like spending time on open source means losing some friend/family time. Also it takes a lot of effort to make a whole project. But there are people who seem to manage it all well. When do they work?!? How do they find time?!?

To get a small clue on this, I figured if I visualize all their github commits, I can see their open source work patterns. This will help me understand how they spend their time. That is what this project started as.

There is still more I'd like to do in this project - allow adjustable time zones etc. I may do that over time. But I feel somewhat satisfied for creating a working prototype where I learned how to query an external API using JSONP and use d3.js to visualize some data.
